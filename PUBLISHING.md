# Publishing Runxin Local on GitHub and HACS

The source tree is prepared for the public `Danirv/runxin-local` repository and HACS distribution.

## 1. Repository metadata

If preparing a fresh clone/template, configure the repository owner once:

```bash
python scripts/configure_repository.py Danirv --repo runxin-local
```

Funding can be configured through GitHub Sponsors and/or Ko-fi. Then verify:

```bash
python scripts/publication_check.py
python scripts/audit.py
python scripts/field_surface_audit.py
python -m pytest -q
python -m compileall -q custom_components/ypsilon_local scripts tests
```

### Repository rename

Rename `Danirv/ypsilon-local` to `Danirv/runxin-local` in GitHub repository Settings. Keep the old name unused so GitHub's existing redirects remain valid. Update local Git remotes to the new URL. Issues, PRs, stars and release history remain attached to the same repository; do not create a replacement repository or duplicate HACS installation.

The visible manifest/HACS name changes, while `custom_components/ypsilon_local`, domain/service names, unique IDs and the release ZIP's integration folder remain unchanged. Existing HA entries should be retained. Check a normal HACS update and the GitHub redirect after renaming; if an older HACS version still shows the old repository name, refresh its metadata before considering any reinstall.

## 2. Repository requirements

Recommended description:

> Local Home Assistant integration for Runxin F79D / BroadLink BL3372 water softeners, including ATH/BWT Ypsilon G6 and Euro-Clear Midnight, with read-only compatibility diagnostics for additional models.

Keep Issues enabled and useful topics such as `home-assistant`, `hacs`, `custom-component`, `water-softener`, `runxin`, `broadlink`, and `ypsilon`.

The repository includes HACS validation, hassfest, the offline protocol/architecture audit, and an automated release workflow. Do not ignore validator failures before publishing or while a HACS default-inclusion request is open.

## 3. Publish a GitHub Release from the web

The preferred release path does not require a local Git clone:

1. Choose a **new, unused** semantic version. Never reuse a version that already has a GitHub Release, even if `main` contains newer code.
2. Update `manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `info.md` to that same version.
3. Merge those release changes into `main` only after HACS, hassfest and the offline audit are green.
4. Open GitHub **Actions** → **Publish GitHub release**.
5. Select **Run workflow** and make sure the branch selector is `main`.
6. Run the workflow.

The web workflow reads the version directly from `custom_components/ypsilon_local/manifest.json`, runs the full publication/audit/field-surface/unit-test/compile checks, refuses an existing GitHub Release, creates or recovers the matching annotated `v<manifest version>` tag, checks out that exact tag, validates the tagged source again, builds the manual-install ZIP and creates the GitHub Release.

A tag pushed manually is handled by the tag-triggered job, which performs the same validation before creating the release. A tag created by the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not need a second workflow run; the web-release job completes the release itself after validating the tagged source.

### Prereleases and maintenance changes

A version containing `-` (for example `2.9.0-alpha.1`) is published automatically with `--prerelease --latest=false`; the latest stable release remains selected. Verify the prerelease flag and ZIP after publication. Model support/evidence is independent of the release label: an Alpha tag does not itself disable controls.

Unreleased maintenance changes must use a **new version before publishing**. Never rerun publication of an existing tag to distribute newer main code. Run the complete native HA suite using `requirements-test-ha.txt` and `requirements-test-ha-baseline.txt` as separate environments; the release job itself runs the lightweight offline suite.

### Git CLI alternative

If a local clone is available, the same release can still be started by tagging the exact manifest version:

```bash
VERSION="$(python -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("custom_components/ypsilon_local/manifest.json"))["version"])')"
git tag -a "v${VERSION}" -m "Runxin Local ${VERSION}"
git push origin "v${VERSION}"
```

Do not manually create a GitHub Release for the same tag; the workflow owns release creation.

## 4. Test through HACS

Before requesting default inclusion, add the repository to HACS as a custom **Integration**, install/update it, restart Home Assistant, configure the device, and verify the real hardware path.

## 5. HACS default inclusion

Current HACS requirements include a public GitHub repository, passing HACS + hassfest actions, brand assets, repository description/topics/issues, and a full GitHub Release created after successful validation actions.

The project currently has an inclusion request open at `hacs/default#10717`. Normal repository maintenance and new releases can continue while it waits in the review queue; do not open duplicate inclusion PRs or comment on the queue PR unless critical information or reviewer feedback requires it.

## Release discipline

For each release:

1. Confirm the intended version does **not** already exist as a GitHub Release.
2. Update `manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `info.md` together.
3. Run publication check, audit, field-surface audit, pytest and compileall.
4. Merge only with HACS/hassfest/audit green.
5. Prefer **Actions → Publish GitHub release → Run workflow** on `main`; alternatively push exactly `v<manifest version>` from Git.
6. Verify the resulting release tag, asset and main-branch validation runs.
7. Never move or recreate an already-published release tag to include later code; publish a new patch version instead.

Never commit vendor APKs, firmware, proprietary binary/script dumps, credentials, private/pairing keys, or unredacted packet captures.
